## Description
This is a coding bootcamp homework assignment to create a "burger logger" with MySQL, Node, Exress, Handlebars, and a homemade ORM. The application, deployed on Heroku, allows a user to update a list of burgers to eat, and then track eaten burgers.  It uses an express backend and retrieves burger data from a MySQL database.
